# Simple-Process-Logger-v2 üîí

Welcome to the **Simple Process Logger v2**! Written in C for optimal performance and low-level system access, this version is a significant upgrade over [Simple Process Logger v1](https://github.com/Bharat-Ascend-Esports/Simple-Process-Logger). With features like secure HTTPS communication, detailed error handling, and JSON payload integration, it offers robust and secure process monitoring. For those with simpler needs, v1 remains available as a lightweight alternative.
